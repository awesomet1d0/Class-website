          <td>Fun game Most of the time. The comunity is not bad. Pretty nice to beggiers. I asked a few people about this game. However with any online competative game you run into people that might get angry. There are a lot of micro transations but they are all cosmetic. </td>

          <td>Fortnite (Free to Play) (6/10) </td>
          <td> Moblie / Epic Games / Xbox / PlayStation / Nintendo Switch / Stadia </td></td>
          <td>This game is fun with friends but not so much by youself. There is so much to do in this game from playing no build, build, Rocket racing, Proximity chat battle royal, Community made maps, or just messing around with you friends. The main thing I dislike about this game is that they are mostly relying on collabs with other franchises now then making their own stuff. The game can also get bland after a while, but that is what you play free for. </td>

        <tr>
          <td>Pokemon Unite (Free to Play) (3/10) </td>
          <td> Nintendo Switch / Mobile </td>
          <td> I used to love this game but now its kinda bland. It is very pay to win because some of the pokemon are much stronger then the free ones and yo get stronger the more you play. That may sound good in pratice but this game doesnt have skill based matchmaking so you might get stuck with someone who has WAY too many hours in this game as your oopponet and they just overpower you and you can't do much about it. It is a decent time waster however.</td>
