          <td>This game is fun with friends but not so much by youself. There is so much to do in this game from playing no build, build, Rocket racing, Proximity chat battle royal, Community made maps, or just messing around with you friends. THe main thing I dislike about this game is that they are mostly relying on collabs with other franchises now then making their own stuff. The game can also get bland after a while, but that is what you play free for. </td>
