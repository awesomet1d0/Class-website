          <td> Well its peggle. Not much to say about it. You shoot the ball try to hit the orange pegs and clear the level. YOU WILL BECOME A PEGGLE MASTER. I used to talk about this game as a joke but this game is amazing. Its on so many platforms with diffrent versions and every version is great. You pay for much less then you should for this old classic. </td>

          <td> This game is a classic. A game where you fight bosses, gear up, Grind for gear, build massive structures, Show off you skills, fight other player, Or just explore. There is so much to do in this masterpeice of a game. It might not look the best to you with its 2D graphics and it doesn't hold you hand but it is a masterpeice. It was supposed to get a final update forever ago but now its still getting updated. With new collabs like Palworld and much more. This is one of the must have games, And when you get bored of the base game the modded community has you covered. The community for this game is one of the strongest and most helpful. Try it out.</td>
