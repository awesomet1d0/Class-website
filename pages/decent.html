          <td> This game is a fun platform fighter to play with your friends. It has many unique fighters. The thing I like that sets it apart from game like smash bros and other fighters is that the community makes custom fighters you can download and play from the workshop. You can play as a chair, a gamecube, ronold the clown, and even morgana from persona 5. The game is highly customizeable and I reccomend this one over the sequal. </td>

          <td>  This game is is normally called pokemon with guns. But it really feels like more than that. Its like if Arc Survival Evolved  mixed with Pokmeon. You catch pals and build bases and automate production with the help of your pals. then you get stronger explore upgrade automation and gear and then go on. As of writing this they just sent out the ultrakill crossover update and just did the terraria crossover update. This game holds a small part in my heart as a good game that I can't wait to see how far it goes. </td></tr>
